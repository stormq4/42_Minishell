# Minishell
Writing our own Shell that behaves like bash

## Compiling & running the shell
Make sure you install the readline library using brew:
```
brew install readline
```
<br />
Clone the repository and enter directory in you comand line:
```
git clone https://github.com/stormq4/42_Minishell.git
cd 42_Minishell
```
<br />
To compile the program run:
```
make
```
<br />
To re compile the program run:
```
make re
```
<br />
To run the **unit tester** run:
```
make utest
```
<br />
To run the **integration test** run:
```
make itest
```
<br />
Finally run the following command to have fun with minishell executable:
```
./minishell
```

## What I learned 
 - Concurrency using processes & forking
 - Integration & Unit testing using different types of testing frameworks ([Unity](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity) && [42ShellTester](https://github.com/we-sh/42ShellTester))
 - Working in teams, while writing scalable code
