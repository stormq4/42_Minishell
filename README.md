# Minishell
Writing our own Shell that behaves like bash

## What I learned 
 - Concurrency using processes & forking
 - Integration & Unit testing using different types of testing frameworks ([Unity](http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity) && [42ShellTester](https://github.com/we-sh/42ShellTester))
 - Working in teams, while writing scalable code
